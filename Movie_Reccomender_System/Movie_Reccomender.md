# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommender System using Machine Learning

A personalized movie recommendation system that suggests films to users based on their preferences, viewing history, and similar users' behavior. This project uses collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques in Python.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Content-Based Filtering using TF-IDF on movie descriptions and genres
- Collaborative Filtering using matrix factorization (SVD)
- Hybrid Recommendation combining both methods
- Web interface with Streamlit (optional)
- Clean and modular Python codebase

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Surprise (for SVD-based collaborative filtering)
- Streamlit (for frontend)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)
