Hi All

This project implements an AI agent that learns to play Flappy Bird autonomously using Reinforcement Learning techniques. By leveraging Deep Q-Learning (DQN), the agent trains through trial and error to master the game, improving its performance over time without human intervention.

ðŸŽ® About the Project

The AI observes the game environment and takes actions (flap or do nothing) based on its current state.
Rewards are given for staying alive and penalties are applied for collisions.
The goal is to maximize the total score (number of pipes passed).
